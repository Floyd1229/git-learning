# GENERAL SYNTAX + OBJECT ENV


# Print a string
print("This line will be printed")

# For code indentation, best to use 4 spaces
x = 1
if x == 1:
    # indented 4 spaces
    print("x is 1.")

# To view all objects, go to Jupyter interactive window, click on ellipses (...),
# then select "Variables"
    
# Python uses 0 to indicate the 1st element/index of an object
mylist = [1, 2, 3]
print(mylist[0])

# Delete individual objects
del x

# VARIABLES    


# Python supports integers (whole numbers), floating point numbers (decimals), and complex numbers
myint = 7
print(myint)

# Can define a float using several different notations
# Notation 1
myfloat = 7.0
print(myfloat)
# Notation 2
myfloat1 = float(7)
print(myfloat1)

# Strings are defined with either a single or double quote
# Double quotes makes it easier to include apostrophes in a string
mystring1 = 'hello'
print(mystring1)
mystring2 = "Don't worry about apostrophes"
print(mystring2)

# One can use operators to combine multiple defined objects
one = 1
two = 2
three = one + two
print(three)

hello = "hello"
world = "world"
hellowworld = hello + " " + world
print(hellowworld)

# >1 variable assignments to >1 object can be done on the same line
a, b = 3, 4
print(a, b)

# You CANNOT use operators to combine number and string objects
print(one + two + hello)

# LISTS
# Can contain any type of variable & as many variables as desired
# Can be iterated over and added to in a sample manner using .append() after the list name


# Lists are defined using square brackets []
mylist = []

# Add to existing list using .append()
mylist.append(1)
mylist.append(2)
mylist.append(3)

# Each list element will be separated by a comma within the list
print(mylist)

# Print elements within list
print(mylist[0]) # print the 1st element in mylist
print(mylist[1]) # print the 1st element in mylist
print(mylist[2]) # print the 1st element in mylist

# Prints out 1,2,3 each in its own line
for x in mylist:

# Can use operators to duplicate the number of a variable

# BASIC STRING OPERATIONS


# To print quotes in a string, need to surround with double quotes
print("single quotes are ' '")

# Length of a string is calc by # of characters, punctuation marks, AND spaces
astring = "Hello world!"
print(len(astring)) # output = 12

# Counts the position of the 1st o in "Hello World!"
# REMEMBER: Python starts counting elememts (indices) at 0
print(astring.index("o"))

# Count the # of occurrences of "l"
print(astring.count("l"))

# Print all characters between indices 3 to 6
# 3:7 = tells Python: "give me characters between 3 and UP TO 7 (NOT including 7)"
print(astring[3:7])

# Starting with 3, Print every 2nd character between indices 3 to 6
# splice syntax = [start:stop:step]
print(astring[3:7:2]) # output = D "" (aka space)

# Starting with 3, print every 1st character between indices 3 to 6
print(astring[3:7:1])

# Can use splice syntax to reverse a string
# start = all characters (:)
# stop = all characters (:)
# step = -1 (print each character starting from the end of the string)
print(astring[::-1])

# Convert all string characters to upper and lowercase 
print(astring.upper())
print(astring.lower())

# Does the object's string start/end with a user-defined string?
# .startswith() and .endswith () are Boolean functions (i.e. True or False)
print(astring.startswith("Hello"))
print(astring.endswith("asdfasdfasdf"))

# Split a string into a list based on a user-defined character/delimiter
astring.split(" ")

# MODULES AND PACKAGES
# Module = piece of software with a specific functionality
    # In python, modules = Python files with a .py extension
    # Each module is made up of a different file, which may be edited separately
    # Modules can have set of fxns, classes, variables that are defined and implemented
# Package = set of python modules
# Library = collection of packages


# Example module called "mygame"
    # directory = mygame/
    # modules "game" and draw"
        # mygame/game.py
        # mygame/draw.py

# Script from draw.py module:
def draw_game():
    ...

def clear_screen(screen):
    ...

# Script for the game.py module:
# Import the draw module (from draw.py) as a package
import draw

def play_game():
    ...

def main():
    result = play_game() # play_game() is from "game" module, so don't need to specify game.play_game()
    draw.draw_game(result) # draw_game() from "draw" module, which has been imported as a package

# this means that if this script is executed, then 
# main() will be executed
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

# NOTE: when python imports a module, creates a .pyc file
# .pyc = python compiled file = file compiled into bytecode so won't have to
# parse the original .py file each time want to load the module

# Namespace = system where each object named and can be accessed in Python
# Example: import draw_game() into namespace using "from" command
# so that you don't have to call draw.draw_game() whenever you want to use draw_game()
from draw import draw_game

def main():
    result = play_game()
    draw_game(result)

# If want to import all objects from a module, use *
from draw import *

# The 1st time a module is loaded into Python, it's initialized by
# executing the module's code once
# If another module in your code imports a previously loaded module,
# it won't be loaded again = any local variables from said module = "singleton"
# Singleton = variables initialized only once

# Example: in draw.py module, initialize main_screen object as a singleton
class Screen():
    ...

def clear_screen(screen):
    ...

def draw_game():
    # when clearing the screen we can use the main screen object initialized in this module
    clear_screen(main_screen)

# initialize main_screen as a singleton
main_screen = Screen()

# Can tell python interpreter where to look for modules
# using PYTHONPATH environment variable in terminal
# Aside from default local directory & built in modules,
# PYTHONPATH gives additional directories to search for modules
# PYTHONPATH=/path/directory python game.py

# Can also use sys.path.append()
# NOTE: execute this BEFORE running import command
import sys
sys.path.append("/path/directory")

# Exploring modules: dir() and help()
# Import module "urllib" and look for its functions
import urllib
dir(urllib)

# Read more about the request()
help(urllib.request)

# Packages = namespaces containing multiple modules (& packages)
# Aka directories with certain requirements
# MUST contain __init__.py file: indicates that the directory __init__.py is in
# is a Python package --> allows package to be imported as a module

# Example: we create a "foo" directory --> foo = package name
#  In foo, create modules __init__.py and bar.py
# Can import "bar" module in 2 ways:
